  about: `
I'm a final-year HTL computer science student with a passion for building clean, functional applications and working with network technology. I love diving into code, configuring networks, solving problems.
When I'm not programming, you'll find me on the football pitch, watch boxing fights, or talking about cars. Always learning, always improving, always curious about what's next in tech.
